    <p id = "c-align"> 
    Formula 1 is the highest category of global motorsport, drivers have been competing for the <br>
    World Driver's Championship (WDC) since 1950. F1 is typically thought of as a Euro-centric <br>
    competition, but drivers have come from all corners of the globe to participate in the sport. 
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
</p>

    <h2 id = "c-align"> Where do F1 drivers come from? </h2>
    <p id = "c-align"> 
    As you might expect, most F1 drivers come from Europe, even <br>
    after normalising by population. More drivers than you might <br>
    expect come from South America. Australian F1 drivers are also <br>
    quite common, having the third most drivers per 10 million <br>
    people outside of Europe.

    <p id = "c-align"> 
    Zooming into Europe, it's clear that western and central European <br>
    drivers have been most common in F1, with Switzerland having the most <br>
    drivers per 10 million people, followed by the United Kingdom and <br>
    Belgium. Swedish and Finnish drivers are also relatively common. <br>
    No F1 drivers have come from eastern or southeastern Europe (excluding Russia).

    <h2 id = "c-align"> Which countries have been most successful in F1? </h2>
    <p id = "c-align">  
        Going by total championships won, the UK has been the most <br>
        successful, followed by Germany and Brazil. This isn't unexpected, <br>
        given the absolute and relative large number of drivers that <br>
        have come from the UK. <br>
        <br>
        Interestingly, Germany's 12 championships are shared between <br>
        only three different drivers; seven-time champion Michael Schumacher, <br> 
        four-time champion Sebastian Vettel, and one-time winner Nico Rosberg. <br>
        Australian drivers have also been relatively successful with <br>
        five WDC winners, more than Italy, France or the USA.

    </div>
    <p id = "c-align"> 
        The two most successful drivers of all time, Michael Schumacher <br>
        and Lewis Hamilton (both with seven WDC titles each) contribute <br>
        greatly to their nation's overall total. The most successful <br>
        Australian driver in F1 history is Jack Brabham, who won <br>
        three WDC titles in 1959, 1960 and 1966.

    <p id = "c-align"> 
        What if we looked at the proportion of unique champions to <br>
        total number of drivers from each country, instead of total <br>
        championships? From this, we can see that Finnish drivers <br>
        tend to be very successful in F1, three of the nine drivers <br>
        from Finland that have competed in the sport have become <br>
        eventual champions. <br>
        <br>
        Australia is third best according to this metric, behind only <br>
        Finland and Austria, with almost 12% of all Australian F1 drivers <br>
        becoming champions. Perhaps most interestingly, Australian drivers <br>
        tend to be more successful (relatively speaking) than western <br>
        European nations like the UK, Italy and France, with only 6%, <br>
        2% and 1% of their drivers becoming champions respectively.
